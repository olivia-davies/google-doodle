## Brainstorm Ideas

1. Songkran
 * Thai New Year's festival. 
 * The Thai New Year's Day is 13 April every year, but the holiday period includes 14â€“15 April as well.
 * Before the festival - blessings are given and obtained by pouring water over the hands of elders and monks
 * Conventionally, friends and family celebrate Songkran by splashing water on each other in the form of a wish for a year filled with blessings (seeking good fortune) and by visiting temples
