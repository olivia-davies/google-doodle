## Research for Ideas
  
For my topic, I chose to do Google page featuring Pusheen Cat as the focus. Pusheen Cat is a meme and something that started off as a cartoon cat in both a comic and a featured sticker on Facebook. Since Pusheen Cat has become a viral and is widely seen, I tried to look up the history of this cat and how it came to be. Sadly, the only sites that I could find information regarding this topic were a Wikipedia page and the cat’s homepage that is supported by Tumblr. I was expecting a little more but honestly, it’s a meme and a prime example of rising popularity of cats on the internet. 

Pusheen was created by two people name Claire Belton and Andrew Duff in 2010 for a comic strip on their site http://everyday-cute.tumblr.com/. In the comic was featured multiple anThe name for this cat comes from the Gaelic word “puisín” which is translated as “cat”. A cute grey tabby cat with a literal translated word took its place along catty celebs Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, and Lil Bub.

* Pusheen is an example of the popularity of cats on the Internet. An exhibition at the New York City Museum of the Moving Image examined the phenomenon [5] The Facebook page for Pusheen has over 9.1 million fans as of February 2016.[6] The brand has expanded with merchandise.

* Pusheen first appeared in 2011 in the comic "Pusheen Things" on Claire Belton and Andrew Duff's website, Everyday Cute.[1] In 2011, Belton and Duff launched a spin-off site dedicated to Pusheen. In 2013, Belton published I Am Pusheen The Cat, a collection of comic strips featuring Pusheen.

* But despite Pusheen’s popularity — she’s got over 9 million likes on Facebook and 108,000 Twitter followers — despite the fact that the chubby kitty defines our generation, folks don’t know a lot about her. Did you even know Pusheen was a girl, for instance?

* Pusheen is based on a real-life cat that Belton grew up with. While the strip implies that Pusheen still lives with the cartoonists, in reality neither Carmen nor Pusheen stayed ever with them. Carmen lived with Duff’s parents and Pusheen lived with Belton’s parents alongside three other cats.
